                        <h4>Hello! Here you can find most usual Errors</h3>
                        </br>
                        <h5>1. Syntax Error</h5>

                        <p>Just like human languages, computer languages have grammar rules. But while humans are able to communicate with less-than-perfect grammar, computers can’t ignore mistakes, i.e. syntax errors.</p>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p>As your proficiency with programming language increases, you will make syntax errors less frequently.The easiest way to prevent them from causing you problems is to be aware of them early.<br> Many text editors or IDEs will come with the ability to warn you about syntax errors at the time of writing.</p>
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        <h5>3. Compilation Errors</h5>
                        <p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Some programming languages require a compilation step. Compilation is where your high-level language converts into a lower-level language that the computer can understand better. A compilation or compile-time error happens when the compiler doesn’t know how to turn your code into the lower-level code.</p>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p>Like syntax errors, you will get better at avoiding these with time, but in general, the best thing you can do is get early feedback when it happens.</p>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <h5>4. Arithmetic Errors</h5>
                        <p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>An arithmetic error is a type of logic error but involves mathematics. A typical example when performing a division equation is that you cannot divide by zero without causing an issue. Very few people would write 5 / 0, but you might not think that the size of something in your system might sometimes be zero, which would lead to this type of error.</p>  
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <br>    
                        <h5>5. Runtime Errors</h5>
                        <p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Runtime errors happen as a user is executing your program. The code might work correctly on your machine, but on the webserver, there might be a different configuration, or it might be interacted with in a way that could cause a runtime error.</p>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p>Make sure you have good error reporting in place to capture any runtime errors and automatically open up new bugs in your ticketing system. Try and learn from each bug report so that in future you can guard against this type of error.</p>
